## 2. Description

Air pollution analysis plays a critical role in understanding **environmental and public health risks**.  
In this project, **NO₂ concentration data** is statistically modeled using a **Gaussian distribution**.

Instead of relying on simple mean–variance estimation, **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** is employed to obtain **more accurate and reliable parameters**.  
The learned probability density function provides insights into the underlying distribution of NO₂ levels across India.

This notebook demonstrates the **complete pipeline**—from raw data ingestion to probabilistic modeling—using **Python and scientific computing libraries**.
